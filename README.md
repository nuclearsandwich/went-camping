This is my website. It's written using [Camping], [Markaby], and the [Bootstrap]
CSS framework. It uses [Puma] for its application server, just 'cause.

It really doesn't do a whole lot, I just wanted to learn some new things and
needed a landing page that doesn't look like it's from 2002. The content is all
static for now, but I expect it to grow and grow as I learn and do more things.
